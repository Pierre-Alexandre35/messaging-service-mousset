## Project Context
My parents own a small clothes shop in a tinny village in France. Since 2018, they are reaching their customers with text-message marketing campaigns. Howvwer, they had to face a lot of different problems that this app is trying to solve:
1) Limited: most mobile service providers are limiting the number of recipients for texting (often to 200 per month)
2) Time-consuming: it took my parents few hours to text their 800 customers and figure out which recipients did not get the message due to limitations
3) Unsecured: the only place where they had customer-related informations stored was a single Android smarphone. What about if they lose it? 

My goal was to build a easy-to-use tool for them to let them text their customers in one click and set up a "real" database:
- I exported Android contacts to .csv using Coolmuster Android Assistant
- Built a small ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline in Python to load data from .csv to MongoDB 
- Created a Flask / Python app to display all records (customers) from the database 
- Set up a Twilio business account and obtain a french phone number (+33) with SMS capacity
- Created a endpoint with a html-form to send a text-message to every users using Twilio Messaging API
