## Description
Platform to send text messages to individuals or groups of customers in 1 click.


## Context
My parents have a small retail business and they are storing informations about their customers on a small Microsoft Excel file. Since 2018, they are doing 2 to 3 SMS text message marketing campaigns every year. They have 2 issues:
1) They could not send +1,000 text messages with a single phone. They had to use multiple phones which was not really reliable. 
2) It took them multiple hours for each campaigns to text every customers. 

We had to build a easy-to-use tool for them to let them text their customers in one click.
